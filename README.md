# 🐱 Napping Cats — NFT Project

## Overview

Napping Cats is an educational project designed to explore and implement Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum using smart contracts and a simple web interface.

The project introduces the core differences between fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens, demonstrates how NFTs are represented on-chain, and shows how they can be traded through a decentralized application (dApp).

This repository contains:

- A basic NFT smart contract implementation
- A concrete NFT collection called Napping Cats
- A web showcase to view, buy, and sell NFT
